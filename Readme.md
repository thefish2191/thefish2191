## More about me

Not an exceptional person, I do enjoy learning stuff here and there, I kinda love computers, and all related stuff. I also love math, and I'm looking forward to get a degree on maths.  
 I'm also learning data processing, and machine learning.

 [This song](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=-eykG5qt9zI&feature=gws_kp_track) hits me:
> Not much to show  
Underachieving, average Joe  
But I'm a hell of a lover  
A damn good brother  
And I wear this heart on my sleeve  
And that might not mean much to you  
But it does to me
